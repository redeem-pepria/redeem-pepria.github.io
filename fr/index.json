However, these solutions require centralizing user data, which raises concerns over data privacy, security, and the monopolization of user data by a few actors. To address those concerns, we propose PriviRec and PriviRec-k, two complementary recommendation frameworks. In PriviRec, we show that it is possible to decompose widely used filters so that they can be computed in a distributed setting using Secure Aggregation and a distributed version of the Randomized Power Method, without revealing individual users contributions. PriviRec-k extends this approach by having users securely aggregate low-rank projections of their contributions, enabling a tunable balance between communication overhead and recommendation accuracy. We demonstrate theoretically as well as experimentally on Gowalla, Yelp2018, and Amazon-Book that our methods achieve performance comparable to centralized state-of-the-art recommender systems and superior to decentralized ones, while preserving confidentiality and low communication and computational overheads.","tags":["BSPM","decentralized","distributed","GF-CF","privacy","Secure Aggregation"],"title":"PriviRec: Confidential and Decentralized Graph Filtering for Recommender Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Renaud Gaucher","Aymeric Dieuleveut","Hadrien Hendrikx"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1759708800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1759708800,"objectID":"8d710b5321b1cafc2d7af8576c5c6a4b","permalink":"https://redeem-pepria.github.io/fr/publication/gaucher-unified-breakdown-analysis-2025/","publishdate":"2025-10-19T16:03:14.603774Z","relpermalink":"/fr/publication/gaucher-unified-breakdown-analysis-2025/","section":"publication","summary":"In decentralized machine learning, different devices communicate in a peer-to-peer manner to collaboratively learn from each other’s data. Such approaches are vulnerable to misbehaving (or Byzantine) devices. We introduce F-RG, a general framework for building robust decentralized algorithms with guarantees arising from robust-sum-like aggregation rules F. We then investigate the notion of breakdown point, and show an upper bound on the number of adversaries that decentralized algorithms can tolerate. We introduce a practical robust aggregation rule, coined CS+, such that CS+-RG has a near-optimal breakdown. Other choices of aggregation rules lead to existing algorithms such as ClippedGossip or NNA.

Conversely, existing fully decentralized approaches typically rely on relaxed adversarial models or pairwise noise cancellation, the latter suffering from substantial accuracy degradation if parties unexpectedly disconnect. In this work, we propose IncA, a new protocol for fully decentralized mean estimation, a widely used primitive in data-intensive processing. Our protocol, which enforces differential privacy, requires no central orchestration and employs low-variance correlated noise, achieved by incrementally injecting sensitive information into the computation. First, we theoretically demonstrate that, when no parties permanently disconnect, our protocol achieves accuracy comparable to that of a centralized setting-already an improvement over most existing decentralized differentially private techniques. Second, we empirically show that our use of low-variance correlated noise significantly mitigates the accuracy loss experienced by existing techniques in the presence of dropouts.","tags":["decentralized mean estimation","decentralized optimization","differential privacy"],"title":"Dropout-Robust Mechanisms for Differentially Private and Fully Decentralized Mean Estimation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marc Damie","Edwige Cyffers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1759276800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1759276800,"objectID":"531ba05b7593cd17d68f1319980bdf7c","permalink":"https://redeem-pepria.github.io/fr/publication/damie-fedivertex-graph-dataset-2025/","publishdate":"2025-10-19T16:03:14.532186Z","relpermalink":"/fr/publication/damie-fedivertex-graph-dataset-2025/","section":"publication","summary":"Decentralized machine learning - where each client keeps its own data locally and uses its own computational resources to collaboratively train a model by exchanging peer-to-peer messages - is increasingly popular, as it enables better scalability and control over the data. A major challenge in this setting is that learning dynamics depend on the topology of the communication graph, which motivates the use of real graph datasets for benchmarking decentralized algorithms. Unfortunately, existing graph datasets are largely limited to for-profit social networks crawled at a fixed point in time and often collected at the user scale, where links are heavily influenced by the platform and its recommendation algorithms. The Fediverse, which includes several free and open-source decentralized social media platforms such as Mastodon, Misskey, and Lemmy, offers an interesting real-world alternative. We introduce Fedivertex, a new dataset of 182 graphs, covering seven social networks from the Fediverse, crawled weekly over 14 weeks. We release the dataset along with a Python package to facilitate its use, and illustrate its utility on several tasks, including a new defederation task, which captures a process of link deletion observed on these networks.","tags":["FOS: Computer and information sciences","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)"],"title":"Fedivertex: A Graph Dataset Based on Decentralized Social Networks for Trustworthy Machine Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pierre Jobic","Aurélien Mayoue","Sara Tucci Piergiovanni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1759276800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1759276800,"objectID":"0be16b9c8cbdf61aa16a29396e48e4dd","permalink":"https://redeem-pepria.github.io/fr/publication/jobic-label-leakage-regression-2025-a/","publishdate":"2025-10-19T16:03:14.634899Z","relpermalink":"/fr/publication/jobic-label-leakage-regression-2025-a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Label Leakage in Regression Federated Learning Using Cryptographic Tools","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cédric Gouy-Pailler"],"categories":null,"content":"We are pleased to announce the REDEEM project retreat taking place in Annecy.\nThis two-day seminar will bring together project members and partners to present, exchange, and discuss ongoing research on decentralized, robust and privacy-preserving learning.\nVenue Centre Jean XXIII\n10 Chemin du Bray\n74940 Annecy-le-Vieux\nProgram Day 1 — September 24, 2025 Time Speaker Title 09:00-09:30 — Arrival 09:30-10:15 Cédric Gouy-Pailler Introduction 10:15-10:45 César Sabater Secure Millon-party Computation of Machine Learning Models 10:45-11:15 — Break 11:15-12:00 Jan Ramon Privacy 12:00-13:30 — Lunch 13:30-14:00 Ousmane Touat Towards Byzantine Resilient and Privacy Preserving Decentralized Learning 14:00-14:30 Johan Leydet Exploiting Nearest Neighbor Mixing: Nearest Neighbor Poisoning 14:30-14:50 Mathieu Gestin Privacy-Preserving Federated Averaging with Byzantine Aggregators and Asynchronous Communication 14:50-15:10 — Break 15:10-15:30 Renaud Gaucher A unified Breakdown analysis of Byzantine Robust Gossip 15:30-15:50 Mohamed Maouche GRANITE : a Byzantine-Resilient Dynamic Gossip Learning Framework 15:50-16:10 Paul Mangold Federated Reinforcement Learning 16:15-20:00 — Social activities 20:00 — Dinner — Brasserie Saint Maurice, 9 rue du Collège Chapuisien, 74000 Annecy Day 2 — September 25, 2025 Time Speaker Title 9:30-9:50 Hadrien Hendrikx Benchmarks for decentralized optimization 9:50-10:10 Brandon Mosqueda Privacy-preserving decentralized learning with trustlessness: A survey 10:10-10:30 Jean-Baptiste Fest Decentralized Optimization Mean-field Approaches 10:30-10:50 — Break 10:50-11:10 Lucas Versini A Markov Chain Analysis of Stochastic Algorithms in Decentralized Learning 11:10-11:30 Cédric Prigent Efficient Federated Learning Clustering with Local Feature Extraction 11:30-12:50 Cédric Gouy-Pailler Combining homomorphic encryption and differential privacy in federated learning 12:00-… — Lunch \u0026amp; Departure We look forward to welcoming you in Annecy for two days of scientific exchange and collaboration.\n","date":1758326400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1758326400,"objectID":"ae833fb931530c2dc70a09ae1b8c67d4","permalink":"https://redeem-pepria.github.io/fr/post/2025-09-24_retreat/","publishdate":"2025-09-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/fr/post/2025-09-24_retreat/","section":"post","summary":"We are pleased to announce the REDEEM project retreat taking place in Annecy.\nThis two-day seminar will bring together project members and partners to present, exchange, and discuss ongoing research on decentralized, robust and privacy-preserving learning.\n","tags":null,"title":"REDEEM retreat in Annecy","type":"post"},{"authors":["Pierre Jobic","Aurélien Mayoue","Sara Tucci Piergiovanni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1756080000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1756080000,"objectID":"e5473e41180d307fab7690cd4a1af77b","permalink":"https://redeem-pepria.github.io/fr/publication/jobic-regularizing-gradient-reconstruction-2025-a/","publishdate":"2025-10-19T16:03:14.645751Z","relpermalink":"/fr/publication/jobic-regularizing-gradient-reconstruction-2025-a/","section":"publication","summary":"Federated Learning (FL) has gained prominence as a decentralized and privacy-preserving paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a machine learning model under the supervision of a central server but without sharing their data. By design, FL is a solution for data privacy but not model privacy. Recent attacks, such as gradient reconstruction attacks (GRAs) have precisely shown privacy issues when an attacker knows the model parameters sent by a client to the server. In the literature, these privacy issues are mainly explored when clients compute a single gradient descent step on their data (FedSGD). In a more realistic scenario, clients compute several gradient descent steps (FedAvg). This protocol adds intermediate computation steps, which are unknown from the attacker, thus making GRAs less successful. In this paper, we introduce a new regularizer that makes GRAs more efficient under FedAvg.

In this article, we prove that, in the interval model, where arcs are present for entire time intervals, finding a restless temporal path is NP-hard even if the vertex-interval-membership-width is equal to three.

Our criterion is motivated by a refined and more general theoretical analysis of the  textttAll-for-one algorithm, proved to be optimal in Even et al. (2022) for an oracle collaboration scheme. We derive excess loss upper-bounds for smooth objective functions, being either strongly convex, non-convex, or satisfying the Polyak-Łojasiewicz condition; our analysis reveals that the algorithm acts as a variance reduction method where the speed-up depends on a  emphsufficient variance.  We put forward two collaboration methods instantiating the proposed general schema; and we show that one variant preserves the optimality of  textttAll-for-one.

This framework encompasses (proximal) gradient-based algorithms for (regularized) smooth objectives, the Expectation Maximization algorithm, and many problems seen as variational surrogate MM. We show that our framework motivates a unifying algorithm called Stochastic Approximation Stochastic Surrogate MM (SA-SSMM), which includes previous stochastic MM procedures as special instances. We then extend SA-SSMM to the federated setting, while taking into consideration common bottlenecks such as data heterogeneity, partial participation, and communication constraints; this yields FedMM. The originality of FedMM is to learn locally and then aggregate information characterizing the surrogate majorizing function, contrary to classical algorithms which learn and aggregate the original parameter. Finally, to showcase the flexibility of this methodology beyond our theoretical setting, we use it to design an algorithm for computing optimal transport maps in the federated setting.","tags":["Federated Learning","Stochastic Approximation","Stochastic Optimization","Surrogate Methods"],"title":"Federated Majorize-Minimization: Beyond Parameter Aggregation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yacine Belal","Mohamed Maouche","Sonia Ben Mokhtar","Anthony Simonet-Boulogne"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1751328000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1751328000,"objectID":"331f843b5a716a21bb960a6d6a51d45f","permalink":"https://redeem-pepria.github.io/fr/publication/belal-inferring-communities-interest-2025/","publishdate":"2025-10-19T16:03:14.490491Z","relpermalink":"/fr/publication/belal-inferring-communities-interest-2025/","section":"publication","summary":"Collaborative-learning-based recommender systems, such as those employing Federated Learning (FL) and Gossip Learning (GL), allow users to train models while keeping their history of liked items on their devices. While those methods were seen as promising for enhancing privacy, recent research has shown that collaborative learning can be vulnerable to various privacy attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel attack called Community Inference Attack (CIA), which enables an adversary to identify community members based on a set of target items. What sets CIA apart is its efficiency: it operates at a low computational cost by eliminating the need for training surrogate models. Instead, it uses a comparison-based approach, inferring sensitive information by comparing users' models rather than targeting any specific individual model. To evaluate the effectiveness of CIA, we conduct experiments on three real-world recommendation datasets using two recommendation models under both fedarated and gossip-like settings. The results demonstrate that CIA can be up to 10 times more accurate than random guessing. Additionally, we evaluate two mitigation strategies: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) and a Share less policy, which involves sharing fewer, less sensitive model parameters. Our findings suggest that the Share less strategy offers a better privacy-utility trade-off, especially in GL.","tags":["Collaborative Learning","Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)","Information Retrieval (cs.IR)","Privacy Attacks","Recommendation Systems"],"title":"Inferring Communities of Interest in Collaborative Learning-based Recommender Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brandon Alejandro Mosqueda González","Omar Hasan","Lionel Brunie"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1748736000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1748736000,"objectID":"b06f44ef0726694ea5151864f2892e5a","permalink":"https://redeem-pepria.github.io/fr/publication/mosquedagonzalez-mitigation-sybilbased-poisoning-2025-a/","publishdate":"2025-10-19T16:03:14.686891Z","relpermalink":"/fr/publication/mosquedagonzalez-mitigation-sybilbased-poisoning-2025-a/","section":"publication","summary":"Decentralized learning enables collaborative machine learning with enhanced privacy by allowing participants to train models locally and share updates for aggregation instead of sharing raw data. However, such systems are vulnerable to poisoning attacks that may compromise the learning process. This threat becomes even more severe when combined with sybil attacks, where adversaries contribute numerous malicious updates with minimal effort. To overcome this challenge, particularly in the permissionless setup, we propose SyDeLP, a blockchain-enabled protocol for decentralized learning. SyDeLP integrates byzantine tolerant aggregation for poisoning mitigation with a Verifiable Delay Function to counter sybil attacks requiring Proofs of Work (PoW) to participate. Honest behavior is incentivized by dynamically reducing PoW difficulty, decreasing the computational burden for honest nodes over time. Empirical evaluations conducted on a benchmark dataset across three types of poisoning attacks demonstrate that SyDeLP consistently outperforms existing solutions in terms of resilience.","tags":["Adaptive Difficulty","Blockchain","Decentralized Learning","Permissionless","Verifiable Delay Function"],"title":"Mitigation of Sybil-based Poisoning Attacks in Permissionless Decentralized Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cédric Gouy-Pailler"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1747353600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1747353600,"objectID":"fce8ed605fc8d97fccd01e8ddc98a36f","permalink":"https://redeem-pepria.github.io/fr/publication/gouy-pailler-contributions-robustesse-securite-2025/","publishdate":"2025-10-19T16:03:14.60736Z","relpermalink":"/fr/publication/gouy-pailler-contributions-robustesse-securite-2025/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contributions à la robustesse, la sécurité et la confidentialité en apprentissage statistique","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rebecca Clain","Eduardo Fernandes Montesuma","Fred Maurice Ngole Mboula"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1743465600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1743465600,"objectID":"100a80d149495830bf1541e6322f738f","permalink":"https://redeem-pepria.github.io/fr/publication/clain-decentralized-federated-dataset-2025/","publishdate":"2025-10-19T16:03:14.524284Z","relpermalink":"/fr/publication/clain-decentralized-federated-dataset-2025/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["CEA-distrAI"],"title":"Decentralized Federated Dataset Dictionary Learning for Multi-Source Domain Adaptation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aleksei Korneev","Jan Ramon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1742428800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1742428800,"objectID":"e062ca147b950a24e8d7e0731ab75ce5","permalink":"https://redeem-pepria.github.io/fr/publication/korneev-survey-verifiable-cross-silo-2025/","publishdate":"2025-10-19T16:03:14.652289Z","relpermalink":"/fr/publication/korneev-survey-verifiable-cross-silo-2025/","section":"publication","summary":"Federated Learning (FL) is a widespread approach that allows training machine learning (ML) models with data distributed across multiple storage units. In cross-silo FL, which often appears in domains like healthcare or finance, the number of participants is moderate, and each party typically represents a well-known organization. For instance, in medicine data owners are often hospitals or data hubs which are well-established entities. However, malicious parties may still attempt to disturb the training procedure in order to obtain certain benefits, for example, a biased result or a reduction in computational load. While one can easily detect a malicious agent when data used for training is public, the problem becomes much more acute when it is necessary to maintain the privacy of the training dataset. To address this issue, there is recently growing interest in developing verifiable protocols, where one can check that parties do not deviate from the training procedure and perform computations correctly. In this paper, we present a survey on verifiable cross-silo FL. We analyze various protocols, fit them in a taxonomy, and compare their efficiency and threat models. We also analyze Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) schemes and discuss how their overall cost in a FL context can be minimized.

We specifically target radius (minimum eccentricity), diameter (maximum eccentricity), and all-eccentricity computations for which quadratic-time lower bounds are known under plausible conjectures. In each case, we introduce a notion of certificate as a specific set of nodes from which appropriate bounds on all eccentricities can be derived in subquadratic time when this set has sublinear size. The existence of small certificates is a barrier against SETH-based lower bounds for these problems. We indeed prove that for graph classes with small certificates, there exist randomized subquadratic-time algorithms for computing the radius, the diameter, and all eccentricities respectively.Moreover, these notions of certificates are tightly related to algorithms probing the graph through one- to-all distance queries and allow to explain the efficiency of practical radius and diameter algorithms from the literature. Our formalization enables a novel primal-dual analysis of a classical approach for diameter computation that leads to algorithms for radius, diameter and all eccentricities with theoretical guarantees with respect to certain graph parameters. This is complemented by experimental results on various types of real-world graphs showing that these parameters appear to be low in practice. Finally, we obtain refined results for several graph classes.*This work was supported by the French ANR projects ANR-22-CE48-0001 (TEMPOGRAL), ANR-24-CE48-4377 (GODASse) and ANR-23-PEIA-005 (REDEEM).","tags":["INRIA-ARGO"],"title":"Certificates in P and Subquadratic-Time Computation of Radius, Diameter, and All Eccentricities in Graphs","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1735689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1735689600,"objectID":"8af25929ca8895de4f7cefaa32947b2c","permalink":"https://redeem-pepria.github.io/fr/joboffer/inria_janramon_engineer/","publishdate":"2025-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/fr/joboffer/inria_janramon_engineer/","section":"joboffer","summary":"Follow the link to get more details on this opportunity.","tags":["engineer"],"title":"Engineer - Scientific programmer in privacy-preserving federate learning with applications in oncology","type":"joboffer"},{"authors":["Yacine Belal","Mohamed Maouche","Sonia Ben Mokhtar","Anthony Simonet-Boulogne"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1735689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1735689600,"objectID":"6d5f32fad97912b932ac3cb4884efe3a","permalink":"https://redeem-pepria.github.io/fr/publication/belal-granite-byzantine-resilient-dynamic-2025-a/","publishdate":"2025-10-19T16:03:14.484248Z","relpermalink":"/fr/publication/belal-granite-byzantine-resilient-dynamic-2025-a/","section":"publication","summary":"Gossip Learning (GL) is a decentralized learning paradigm where users iteratively exchange and aggregate models with a small set of neighboring peers. Recent GL approaches rely on dynamic communication graphs built and maintained using Random Peer Sampling (RPS) protocols. Thanks to graph dynamics, GL can achieve fast convergence even over extremely sparse topologies. However, the robustness of GL over dy- namic graphs to Byzantine (model poisoning) attacks remains unaddressed especially when Byzantine nodes attack the RPS protocol to scale up model poisoning. We address this issue by introducing GRANITE, a framework for robust learning over sparse, dynamic graphs in the presence of a fraction of Byzantine nodes. GRANITE relies on two key components (i) a History-aware Byzantine-resilient Peer Sampling protocol (HaPS), which tracks previously encountered identifiers to reduce adversarial influence over time, and (ii) an Adaptive Probabilistic Threshold (APT), which leverages an estimate of Byzantine presence to set aggregation thresholds with formal guarantees. Empirical results confirm that GRANITE maintains convergence with up to 30% Byzantine nodes, improves learning speed via adaptive filtering of poisoned models and obtains these results in up to 9 times sparser graphs than dictated by current theory.","tags":["Gossip learning","poisoning attacks","random peer sampling","robust aggregation"],"title":"GRANITE : A Byzantine-Resilient Dynamic Gossip Learning Framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1735689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1735689600,"objectID":"7bc14dd430089e42e54f32d8f0b522b7","permalink":"https://redeem-pepria.github.io/fr/joboffer/inria_janramon_interns/","publishdate":"2025-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/fr/joboffer/inria_janramon_interns/","section":"joboffer","summary":"Contact Jan Ramon if you are interested.","tags":["intern"],"title":"Interships in privacy-preserving decentralized machine learning","type":"joboffer"},{"authors":["Brandon A.

However, such systems are vulnerable to poisoning attacks that may compromise the learning process. This threat becomes even more severe when combined with sybil attacks, where adversaries contribute numerous malicious updates with minimal effort, amplifying their impact. To overcome these challenges, particularly in the permissionless setup, we propose SyDeLP, a blockchain-enabled protocol for decentralized learning. SyDeLP integrates byzantine tolerant aggregation for poisoning mitigation with a novel Verifiable Delay Puzzle to counter sybil attacks requiring Proofs of Work to participate. Honest behavior is incentivized by dynamically reducing puzzle difficulty, decreasing the computational burden for honest nodes over time.

However, this paradigm necessitates the exchange of model parameters or gradients between peers. Such exchanges can be exploited to infer sensitive information about training data, which is achieved through privacy attacks (e.g Membership Inference Attacks -- MIA). In order to devise effective defense mechanisms, it is important to understand the factors that increase/reduce the vulnerability of a given decentralized learning architecture to MIA. In this study, we extensively explore the vulnerability to MIA of various decentralized learning architectures by varying the graph structure (e.g number of neighbors), the graph dynamics, and the aggregation strategy, across diverse datasets and data distributions. Our key finding, which to the best of our knowledge we are the first to report, is that the vulnerability to MIA is heavily correlated to (i) the local model mixing strategy performed by each node upon reception of models from neighboring nodes and (ii) the global mixing properties of the communication graph. We illustrate these results experimentally using four datasets and by theoretically analyzing the mixing properties of various decentralized architectures. Our paper draws a set of lessons learned for devising decentralized learning systems that reduce by design the vulnerability to MIA.","tags":["CNRS-LIRIS"],"title":"Scrutinizing the Vulnerability of Decentralized Learning to Membership Inference Attacks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paul Mangold","Alain Durmus","Aymeric Dieuleveut","Sergey Samsonov","Eric Moulines"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1733097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1733097600,"objectID":"bc5d10cfd7f60d1891a315dcf554e41f","permalink":"https://redeem-pepria.github.io/fr/publication/mangold-refined-analysis-federated-2024/","publishdate":"2025-10-19T16:03:14.679352Z","relpermalink":"/fr/publication/mangold-refined-analysis-federated-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we present a novel analysis of FedAvg with constant step size, relying on the Markov property of the underlying process.

We then argue that this result is coming from a worst-case analysis, and we provide a refined optimization-dependent generalization bound for general convex functions. This new bound reveals that the choice of graph can in fact improve the worst-case bound in certain regimes, and that surprisingly, a poorly-connected graph can even be beneficial for generalization.","tags":["INRIA-ARGO","INRIA-MAGNET"],"title":"Improved Stability and Generalization Guarantees of the Decentralized SGD Algorithm","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rémi Leluc","Aymeric Dieuleveut","François Portier","Johan Segers","Aigerim Zhuman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1720396800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1720396800,"objectID":"bee954922ceea9c15ee608a066cddfff","permalink":"https://redeem-pepria.github.io/fr/publication/leluc-sliced-wasserstein-estimation-spherical-2024-a/","publishdate":"2025-10-19T16:03:14.670321Z","relpermalink":"/fr/publication/leluc-sliced-wasserstein-estimation-spherical-2024-a/","section":"publication","summary":"The Sliced-Wasserstein (SW) distance between probability measures is defined as the average of the Wasserstein distances resulting for the associated one-dimensional projections. As a consequence, the SW distance can be written as an integral with respect to the uniform measure on the sphere and the Monte Carlo framework can be employed for calculating the SW distance. Spherical harmonics are polynomials on the sphere that form an orthonormal basis of the set of square-integrable functions on the sphere. Putting these two facts together, a new Monte Carlo method, hereby referred to as Spherical Harmonics Control Variates (SHCV), is proposed for approximating the SW distance using spherical harmonics as control variates. The resulting approach is shown to have good theoretical properties, e.g., a no-error property for Gaussian measures under a certain form of linear dependency between the variables. Moreover, an improved rate of convergence, compared to Monte Carlo, is established for general measures. The convergence analysis relies on the Lipschitz property associated to the SW integrand. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SHCV against state-of-the-art methods for SW distance computation.","tags":null,"title":"Sliced-Wasserstein Estimation with Spherical Harmonics as Control Variates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pierre Jobic","Aurélien Mayoue","Sara Tucci-Piergiovanni","François Terrier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1719187200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1719187200,"objectID":"2d2da173f8132d8b7926dcf5efe4174f","permalink":"https://redeem-pepria.github.io/fr/publication/jobic-extending-scope-gradient-2024-a/","publishdate":"2025-10-19T16:03:14.62503Z","relpermalink":"/fr/publication/jobic-extending-scope-gradient-2024-a/","section":"publication","summary":"Federated Learning (FL) has gained prominence as a decentralized and privacy-preserving paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a machine learning model under the supervision of a central server. Instead of centralizing the data, clients keep their data locally and share only model parameters during multiple communication rounds. However, recent attacks, such as gradient reconstruction attacks (GRAs) show privacy issues when an attacker knows the communication of a client. In the literature, these privacy issues are mainly explored when clients compute new parameters using a single gradient descent step on their data (FedSGD) and then send them back to the remote server. In a more realistic scenario, the clients' protocol is based on several gradient descent steps (FedAvg). This protocol adds intermediate computation steps, which are unknown from the attacker, thus making GRAs less successful. In this incremental paper, we conduct exhaustive experiments on four state-of-the-art attacks under the FedAvg protocol, on a very basic and a more complex neural network (ResNet-18) with CIFAR100 dataset. These experiments provide the following results 1) a privacy-utility trade-off analysis, 2) insights on the choice of attacks' hyperparameters, 3) the client's local learning rate has little impact on attacks' effectiveness 4) a proof that the privacy risk is not necessarily decreasing over rounds, contrary to common belief.","tags":["CEA-distrAI"],"title":"Extending the Scope of Gradient Reconstruction Attacks in Federated Averaging","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Imane Taibi","Jan Ramon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1719187200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1719187200,"objectID":"0adace4ea82930a11bc6e9c5458732b5","permalink":"https://redeem-pepria.github.io/fr/publication/taibi-honest-fraction-differential-2024/","publishdate":"2025-10-19T16:03:14.772675Z","relpermalink":"/fr/publication/taibi-honest-fraction-differential-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Over the last decades, differential privacy (DP) has become a standard notion of privacy. It allows to measure how much sensitive information an adversary could infer from a result (statistical model, prediction, etc.) he obtains. In privacy-preserving federated machine learning, one aims to learn a statistical model from data owned by multiple data owners without revealing their sensitive data. A common strategy is to use secure multi-party computation (SMPC) to avoid revealing intermediate results. However, DP assumes a very strong adversary who is able to know all information in the dataset except the targeted secret, while most SMPC methods assume a clearly less strong adversary, e.g., it is common to assume that the adversary has bounded computational power and can corrupt only a minority of the data owners (honest majority). As a chain is not stronger than its weakest part, in such combinations the DP provides an overly strong protection at an unnecessarily high cost in terms of utility. We propose honest fraction differential privacy, which is similar to differential privacy but assumes that the adversary can only collude with data owners covering part of the data. This assumption is very similar to the assumptions made by many SMPC strategies. We illustrate this idea by considering the application to the specific task of unregularized linear regression without bias on sufficiently large datasets.","tags":null,"title":"Honest Fraction Differential Privacy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Renaud Gaucher","Hadrien Hendrikx","Aymeric Dieuleveut"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1714953600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fr","lastmod":1714953600,"objectID":"378cb47ce6e302b69db03dd8e8404b82","permalink":"https://redeem-pepria.github.io/fr/publication/gaucher-byzantine-robust-gossip-insights-2024/","publishdate":"2025-10-19T16:03:14.589439Z","relpermalink":"/fr/publication/gaucher-byzantine-robust-gossip-insights-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Distributed approaches have many computational benefits, but they are vulnerable to attacks from a subset of devices transmitting incorrect information.

This novel class of oracles can query the gradient with any given data distribution, and is thus well suited to scenarios in which the training data distribution does not match the target (or test) distribution.
