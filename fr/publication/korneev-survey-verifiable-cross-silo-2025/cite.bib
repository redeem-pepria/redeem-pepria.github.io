 abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is a widespread approach that allows training machine learning (ML) models with data distributed across multiple storage units. In cross-silo FL, which often appears in domains like healthcare or finance, the number of participants is moderate, and each party typically represents a well-known organization. For instance, in medicine data owners are often hospitals or data hubs which are well-established entities. However, malicious parties may still attempt to disturb the training procedure in order to obtain certain benefits, for example, a biased result or a reduction in computational load. While one can easily detect a malicious agent when data used for training is public, the problem becomes much more acute when it is necessary to maintain the privacy of the training dataset. To address this issue, there is recently growing interest in developing verifiable protocols, where one can check that parties do not deviate from the training procedure and perform computations correctly. In this paper, we present a survey on verifiable cross-silo FL. We analyze various protocols, fit them in a taxonomy, and compare their efficiency and threat models. We also analyze Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) schemes and discuss how their overall cost in a FL context can be minimized. Lastly, we identify research gaps and discuss potential directions for future scientific work.},
