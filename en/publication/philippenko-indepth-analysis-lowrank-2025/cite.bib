 abstract = {We analyze a distributed algorithm to compute a low-rank matrix factorization on NNN clients, each holding a local dataset Si∈Rni×dSi∈Rni×d\ mathbf\S\\textasciicircum i \ in \ mathbb\R\\textasciicircum\n_i \ times d\, mathematically, we seek to solve minUi∈Rni×r,V∈Rd×r12∑Ni=1∥Si−UiV⊤∥2FminUi∈Rni×r,V∈Rd×r12∑i=1N‖Si−UiV⊤‖F2min_\\ mathbf\U\\textasciicircum i \ in \ mathbb\R\\textasciicircum\n_i\ times r\, \ mathbf\V\\ in \ mathbb\R\\textasciicircum\d \ times r\ \ \ frac\1\\2\ \ sum_\i=1\\textasciicircum N \ |\ mathbf\S\\textasciicircum i - \ mathbf\U\\textasciicircum i \ mathbf\V\\textasciicircum\ top\ |\textasciicircum 2_\\ text\F\\. Considering a power initialization of VV\ mathbf\V\, we rewrite the previous smooth non-convex problem into a smooth strongly-convex problem that we solve using a parallel Nesterov gradient descent potentially requiring a single step of communication at the initialization step. For any client iii in \1,…,N\\1,…,N\\\1, \ dots, N\\, we obtain a global VV\ mathbf\V\ in Rd×rRd×r\ mathbb\R\\textasciicircum\d \ times r\ common to all clients and a local variable UiUi\ mathbf\U\\textasciicircum i in Rni×rRni×r\ mathbb\R\\textasciicircum\n_i \ times r\. We provide a linear rate of convergence of the excess loss which depends on σmax/σrσmax/σr\ sigma_\\ max\ / \ sigma_\r\, where σrσr\ sigma_\r\ is the rthrthr\textasciicircum\\ mathrm\th\\ singular value of the concatenation SS\ mathbf\S\ of the matrices (Si)Ni=1(Si)i=1N(\ mathbf\S\\textasciicircum i)_\i=1\\textasciicircum N. This result improves the rates of convergence given in the literature, which depend on σ2max/σ2minσmax2/σmin2\ sigma_\\ max\\textasciicircum 2 / \ sigma_\\ min\\textasciicircum 2. We provide an upper bound on the Frobenius-norm error of reconstruction under the power initialization strategy. We complete our analysis with experiments on both synthetic and real data.},
